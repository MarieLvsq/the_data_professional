## Using the `mysql` client
Open up a terminal window from the **Tools->Terminal** menu.

Once the terminal window is open, just type `mysql` into the command line and a new `mysql>` client will start. 

### Running `mysql` statements
The `mysql` client is enabled with all the database and table editing and reading privileges so you can experiment as much as you want.
